// I. Preliminaries
  // I.A. Declare a variable for the user's move
  // I.B. Declare a variable for the computer's move
  // I.C. Declare a variable for the winner of a round
  // I.D. Initialize a capitalization function with one parameter
    // I.D.1. Slice the first character of parameter and assign to firstChar
    // I.D.2. Set that firstChar to upper case
    // I.D.3. Set parameter to lower case, and update parameter
    // I.D.4. Update parameter to exclude first letter
    // I.D.5. Concatenate the substring with firstChar
    // I.D.6. Return the updated parameter
  // I.G. Welcome message


// II. Initialize a function to test if user's move is permitted
  // II.A. Initialize function to test that user's move is a valid option
    // II.A.1. If user move isn't Rock, Paper, or Scissors
      // II.A.2 Then run error message and prompt again
    // II.A.3 Take no action

  // II.B. Call the capitalize function with argument
  // II.C. Call the function to test
  // II.D. Update user's move with capitalized and tested string

// III. Initialize a function, which will generate a move for the computer:
  // III.A. Assign a random number to the computer move variable
    // If the variable is between 0 and 0.33, return Rock
    // Else If the variable is between 0.33 and 0.66, return Paper
    // Else the variable is greater than 0.66, return Scissors
  // III.B.


// IV. Initialize a function to determine the winner of one round
  // IV.A. Using a swtich statement determine winner:
    // IV.A.1.1     If user has Rock and computer has Rock, assign neither to winner variable
    // IV.A.1.2.    If user has Rock and computer has Paper, assign computer to winner variable
    // IV.A.1.3.    If user has Rock and computer has Scissors, assign user to winner variable
    // IV.A.2.1.    If user has Paper and computer has Rock, assign user to winner variable
    // IV.A.2.2.    If user has Paper and computer has Paper, assign neither to winner variable
    // IV.A.2.3.    If user has Paper and computer has Scissors, assign computer to winner variable
    // IV.A.3.1.    If user has Scissors and computer has Rock, assign computer to winner variable
    // IV.A.3.2.    If user has Scissors and computer has Paper, assign user to winner variable
    // IV.A.3.3.    If user has Scissors and computer has Scissors, assign user to winner variable
  // IV.B. Return winner
  

// V. Initialize function to announce a winner
  // V.A.1. If winner variable is user
    // V.A.2. Log "You win! " + user move + " beats " + computer move.
  // V.B.1. If winner variable is computer
    // V.B.2.  Log "You lose! " + computer move + " beats " + user move.
  // V.C.1. If winner variable is neither
    // V.C.2. Log "You tie with " + user move + " and " + computer move. "Let's play again..."
  // V.D. Else take no action


// VI. Initialize a function to initiate round combining above functions


// VII. Initialize function to begin a best-of-five game


// VII. Prompt user to make a move
